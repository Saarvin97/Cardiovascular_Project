# Cardiovascular_Project

For the past few years researchers are studying the analysis based on this cardiovascular disease and many results are being displayed to the public. Based on the previous studies, the most important behavior risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. 

The effects of behavior risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity.  In this project, data relating to cardiovascular disease is discussed and explained on how the data is managed and being interpreted. From here we are able to observe how different factors will affect the presence of cardiovascular disease and what the correlation between these variables are. All the observation has been recorded in the following sections below and appropriate conclusion is made based on the datasets used.
